Welcome to the Drumscratcher site! This page features the hand engraving artwork of John Aldridge.

For those of you who are not familiar with the history of hand
engraving on snare drums, this page will give a little background to
help you start your custom engraving job.

## A Brief History of Hand Engraving

Hand engraving (using nothing but hand power and small blades fitted
into wooden handles) is a centuries old art form. Up until the 1930's
hand engraving was a very common ornamentation technique used by
jewelers and artisans to carve artistic designs, inscriptions, and
patterns into the metal parts of musical instruments. In the early
20th century, prior to the advent of plastics and multiple plating
options, manufacturers were limited to painting or lacquering wood
shell drums, and either painting or applying a plated finish to metal
parts. Almost every drum company of the time offered engraved models,
some with gold plating and some with faux gold plating for a less
expensive option. Engraving was typically applied to the outside of
metal shell snare drums, while some drums also featured engraved
counterhoops, strainers, and lugs as well. With the great depression
and the onset of machine engraving techniques, hand engraving all but
disappeared by the late '30's.

With the relatively new interest in collecting vintage drums that
blossomed in the late 1980's these vintage engraved drums quickly
became the most sought after collectibles in the vintage drum
world. Prices in the late 1980s hovered around $600-$800 for an
engraved snare drum the 1920's. By the time the 90's arrived, the
average price had doubled and showed no signs of slowing down. Today,
an engraved models from the past century can command prices in the
$3000-$15,000 range!

## The Next Generation

John Aldridge came into the story as a drummer and collector intent on
spreading the word about vintage drums through articles in Modern
Drummer at first, then through the publication of his own newsletter,
Not So Modern Drummer. As John learned more about vintage drums and
discovered the unique look of vintage hand engraved drums, he focused
his collecting energies on purchasing one for himself. The only
problem was that his elementary music teacher salary didn't provide
for such luxuries. In typical Okie fashion, Aldridge decided to learn
to engrave well enough to duplicate one of these drums for himself at
a price he could afford. After several years of practicing on his own
the techniques shown to him by a local jeweler, he finally engraved a
drum for himself. Shortly thereafter, customers began to call. From
1986-89, all of his engraving was for friends and individual
customers. But in 1989, DW expressed an interest in having some drums
engraved for some of their endorsers. John took on the job but the
project soon faltered due to problems with shell hardness and other
production issues which had been long forgotten by the drum industry,
and not yet learned by Aldridge.

The Ludwig Drum Company was his next customer. John, using the
information gained from writing about and researching vintage drums,
used this knowledge to re-draw and re-proportion vintage artwork from
Ludwig's Black Beauty snare drums of the 1920's to replicate on the
newly re-introduced Black Beauty which was produced from
1990-1995. Next up came the Slingerland drum company with their Brass
and Copper beauty series with patterns reproduced from the 1928
Slingerland catalog. In 1999, John was engraving the Ludwig 90'th
Anniversary drums, Tama's Kenny Aronoff Signature Series Ltd. Edition,
and Johnny Craviotto's Lake Superior snare drums.

John continues to provide his engraving services to a wide range of
drum companies including Ludwig, A & F Drum Company, Joyful Noise Drum
Company, C & C Drum company and Pearl Drum company, as well as limited
production models for drum shops in the Drum Workshop dealer
network. But you don't have to be a drum company, large or small, to
utilize John's services. He also keeps a steady stream of projects in
the works for individual drummers, famous and not-so-famous. Whether
you have an idea for a custom engraving on your own drum, or you'd
like to have a vintage pattern reproduced on a new drum, John is happy
to help you design your project, personalize it and work with you on
payment options.

## And Now for Something Completely Different

John is also a touring drum tech with the classic rock band, REO
Speedwagon, and has worked with Smashmouth and the Bryan Setzer
Orchestra in this capacity. His familiarity with and work experience
building custom configured drum sets for touring rock bands has lead
to another service offering: designing custom rack systems for touring
drummers. In addition to building the past 14 years of touring sets
for REO, John has also built touring racks/sets for the rock band
TESLA, and is currently designing a kit for drummer Eric Singer for
the final tour of the rock band KISS.
